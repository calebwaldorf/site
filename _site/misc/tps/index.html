 <p>This is a list of meetings that took place at The Public School between 2009-2016, extracted from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919122246/http://www.thepublicschool.org/meetings">Wayback Machine</a>. The individual meetings link to the Wayback Machine&rsquo;s captures, but may not work in all cases.</p>

 <p>In 2007, The Public School was initiated in Los Angeles in the basement of Telic Arts Exchange. The Public School was a school with no curriculum. It was not accredited, did not give out degrees, and it had no affiliation with the public school system. It was a framework that supported autodidactic activities, operating under the assumption that everything is in everything.</p>
