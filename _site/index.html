  <a href="mailto:thereisnothinglesspassive@gmail.com?subject=Hi" class="email"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">mail</span><span>Get in touch</span></a>
    <p>
      I am an artist living in Berlin. Collaborating with writers, artists, curators, educators, designers, and software engineers, I have initiated and helped develop publishing frameworks, educational platforms, and online <a href="#publishing-as-relay__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="publishing-as-relay" class="footnote">archives.</a> The spaces and systems I work on are designed to foster collaboration and reconsider how we approach learning, publishing, and collective engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Among the projects that have defined my approach is Triple Canopy, an online magazine I co-founded in <a href="#triple-canopy-role__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="triple-canopy-role" class="footnote">2007.</a>  Its fourth iteration, developed in collaboration with <a href="#azt__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="azt" class="footnote">Astrom / Zimmer & Tereszkiewicz</a>, introduced a reimagined archive and new <a href="#announcing-4__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="announcing-4" class="footnote">publishing strategies</a>, alongside an updated version of <a href="#b-ber__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="b-ber" class="footnote">b-ber</a>, an open-source system for producing publications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the same time that Triple Canopy launched its first issue, I also began working on The Public School, an initiative that originated at Telic Arts Exchange in Los Angeles. The Public School operated without a traditional curriculum, lacked accreditation, did not offer degrees, and had no ties to the public school system. (After a few years in Los Angeles, the school spread to other <a href="#tps-schools__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="tps-schools" class="footnote">cities.</a>) I served on the committee of The Public School Los Angeles and The Public School Berlin and worked on the platform’s concept, methodology, and associated design and software <a href="#tps-projects__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="tps-projects" class="footnote">development.</a> By the end of the <a href="#tps-org-end__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="tps-org-end" class="footnote">project,</a> there had been more than two thousand proposals for things that people wanted to learn, teach, or see happen. These proposals were turned into hundreds of classes and thousands of meetings across three continents over a period of <a href="#tps-meetings-list__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="tps-meetings-list" class="footnote">eight years.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Concurrently with time devoted to Triple Canopy and The Public School, I have collaborated on other projects, some self-initiated, some with existing institutions. A few highlights include: A Public Library, a space for conversations, presentations, the sharing of resources, and for collective reading, viewing, and learning, that was located within a city library, the Bona-Peiser-Bibliothek in <a href="#a-public-library__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="a-public-library" class="footnote">Berlin;</a> post at MoMA, originally conceived as an online hybrid of an archive, publication platform, and <a href="#post__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="post" class="footnote">participatory network;</a> and Version, an online journal for short-form writing and media <a href="#version__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="version" class="footnote">work.</a> I’ve also had the opportunity to participate in conversations, workshops, and lecture at many <a href="#lectures__endnote" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="lectures" class="footnote">institutions.</a>

        <li id="triple-canopy-role__endnote">After co-founding Triple Canopy in 2007, I served as creative director until 2020 and then technology directory from 2020–22. Over that period, I conceptualized and helped realize different publishing frameworks, both in terms of individual formats as well as contributing to the broader publication strategy, and, at various points and in different capacities, was responsible for visual design, editorial design, software development, and creative and technical direction. <a href="https://calebwaldorf.net/misc/ccc/index.html" target="_blank">Collected here</a> you can find a small sampling of that work.<a href="#triple-canopy-role" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a>

More technical details as well as instructions for using the system can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/triplecanopy/b-ber">open-source repository</a>. In addition to b-ber, Triple Canopy maintains all of the content presentation frameworks—and the content produced with them—that were developed since 2007. With the latest version of Triple Canopy, visitors can easily filter projects by the different frameworks: the first was <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/search?tcapi:has_content_type=tc:contenttype_als">ALS</a>, followed by <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/search?tcapi:has_content_type=tc:contenttype_horizonize">Horizonize</a>, <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/search?tcapi:has_content_type=tc:contentype_alongslide">Alongslide</a>, and finally <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/search?tcapi:has_content_type=tc:contenttype_bber">b-ber</a>.<a href="#b-ber" aria-label="Back to content">↩</a>
